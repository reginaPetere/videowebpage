                [Verse 1]<br>
                Started out on a one way train<br>
                Always knew where I was going to go next<br>
                Didn't know until I saw your face<br>
                I was missing out on every moment<br>
                If you want it, baby, I'll be true<br>
                Would mind it if I said I'm into you (I'm into you)<br>
                <br>
                [Chorus]<br>
                So if it's real, then darling let me know<br>
                I wouldn't mind if you steal the show<br>
                <br>
                [Instrumental]<br>
                <br>
                [Verse 2]<br>
                You and I, we go together<br>
                You're the sky, I'll be the weather<br>
                A Pretty thing, a sun and rain, oh no<br>
                Oh, yeah<br>
                Summer night, perfect occasion<br>
                When I'm by, you know I'll be waiting for you<br>
                Oh, for you<br>
                <br>
                [Chorus]<br>
                So if it's real, then darling let me know<br>
                I wouldn't mind if you steal the show<br>
                So if it's real, then darling let me know<br>
                I wouldn't mind if you steal the show<br>
                <br>
                [Bridge]<br>
                Shine, you shine, live forever, that's forever<br>
                You shine, you shine and steal the show<br>
                <br>
                [Chorus]<br>
                So if it's real, then darling let me know<br>
                I wouldn't mind if you steal the show<br>
